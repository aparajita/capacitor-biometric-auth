# capacitor-biometric-auth&nbsp;&nbsp;[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@aparajita%2Fcapacitor-biometric-auth.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@aparajita%2Fcapacitor-biometric-auth)

This plugin for [Capacitor 7](https://capacitorjs.com) provides access to native biometry and device credentials on iOS and Android. It supports every type of biometry and every configuration option on both platforms. In addition, biometry and device credentials are simulated on the web so you can test your logic without making any changes to your code.

üõë **BREAKING CHANGES:**

- If you are upgrading from a version prior to 6.0.0, please note that [`authenticate()`](#authenticate) now throws an instance of `BiometryError`, and `BiometryError.code` is now typed as [`BiometryErrorType`](#biometryerrortype).

- If you are upgrading from a version prior to 7.0.0, please note that [`authenticate()`](#authenticate) will _immediately_ present a prompt for device credentials if `deviceIsSecure` is true, `allowDeviceCredentials` is true, and no biometry of the requested strength is available.

- If you are upgrading from a version prior to 8.0.0, please note that this plugin now requires Capacitor 7+.

- If you are upgrading from a version prior to 8.0.0, please note that [`addResumeListener`](#addresumelistener) now always returns a Promise and must be awaited.

## Installation

```sh
pnpm add @aparajita/capacitor-biometric-auth
npm install @aparajita/capacitor-biometric-auth
yarn add @aparajita/capacitor-biometric-auth
```

Not using [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/)? You owe it to yourself to give it a try. It‚Äôs faster, better with monorepos, and uses _way, way_ less disk space than the alternatives.

### iOS

üëâ **IMPORTANT!!** In order to use Face ID, you must add the `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` key to your `Info.plist` file. This is a string that describes why your app needs access to Face ID. If you don‚Äôt add this key, the system won‚Äôt allow your app to use Face ID.

1. In Xcode, open your app‚Äôs `Info.plist` file.
2. Hover your mouse over one of the existing keys, and click the `+` button that appears.
3. In the popup that appears, type `Privacy - Face ID Usage Description` and press Enter.
4. In the Value column, enter a string that describes why your app needs access to Face ID.
5. Save your changes.

## Usage

The API is extensively documented in the [TypeScript definitions file](src/definitions.ts). There is also (somewhat incomplete auto-generated) documentation [below](#api). For a complete example of how to use this plugin in practice, see the [demo app](https://github.com/aparajita/capacitor-biometric-auth/blob/main/demo/README.md).

### Checking availability

Although not strictly necessary, before giving the user the option to use biometry (such as displaying a biometry icon), you will probably want to call [`checkBiometry()`](#checkbiometry) and inspect the [`CheckBiometryResult`](#checkbiometryresult) to see what (if any) biometry and/or device credentials are available on the device. Note the following:

- `isAvailable` may be `false` but `biometryType` may indicate the presence of biometry on the device. This occurs if:
  - The current user is not enrolled in biometry.
  - Biometry has been disabled for the current app.
  - On Android, biometric hardware is present but can only be used for _device_ unlock, _not_ by apps. see the [Android note](#android-note) below for more information.

  In such cases the `reason` and `code` will tell you why.

- On iOS, `isAvailable` and `strongBiometryIsAvailable` will always have the same value, because traditionally that‚Äôs the whole point of biometry ‚Äî it‚Äôs supposed to be strong authentication.
- Android unfortunately supports ‚Äústrong‚Äù biometry (usually fingerprint) and ‚Äúweak‚Äù biometry (usually face/iris). `isAvailable` will be `true` if _any_ type of biometry is actually available for use by the app, but `strongBiometryIsAvailable` will be `true` only if strong biometry is available. For example, on a typical device, if it has hardware support for both fingerprint and face unlock, and both are available for use by apps, `isAvailable` will be `true` if either is enrolled, but `strongBiometryIsAvailable` will be `true` only if fingerprint authentication is enrolled.

#### ‚ùóAndroid note

When it comes to biometry, Android is frankly a bit of a mess. Some devices may support ‚Äúweak‚Äù biometry (e.g. face unlock) only for device unlock, and not by apps. But the system reports to this plugin _all_ types of biometric hardware, even if they are not available for use by apps.

üëâ Therefore on Android the only thing you can rely on are the `isAvailable` and `strongBiometryAvailable` properties as simple on/off switches. Do NOT rely on `biometryType` and `biometryTypes` as an indication of what biometry you can actually use.

#### Handling app resume

Because the availability of biometry can change while your app is in the background, it‚Äôs important to check availability when your app resumes. By calling [`addResumeListener()`](#addresumelistener) you can register a callback that is passed a [`CheckBiometryResult`](#checkbiometryresult) when your app resumes.

#### Example

```typescript
import { CheckBiometryResult } from './definitions'

let appListener: PluginListenerHandle

function updateBiometryInfo(info: CheckBiometryResult): void {
  if (info.isAvailable) {
    // Biometry is available, info.biometryType will tell you the primary type.
  } else {
    // Biometry is not available, info.reason and info.code will tell you why.
  }
}

async function onComponentMounted(): Promise<void> {
  updateBiometryInfo(await BiometricAuth.checkBiometry())

  try {
    appListener = await BiometricAuth.addResumeListener(updateBiometryInfo)
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Error) {
      console.error(error.message)
    }
  }
}

async function onComponentUnmounted(): Promise<void> {
  await appListener?.remove()
}
```

### Authenticating

To initiate biometric authentication call [`authenticate()`](#authenticate). `authenticate` takes an [`AuthenticateOptions`](#authenticateoptions) object which you will want to use in order to control the behavior and appearance of the biometric prompt.

If authentication succeeds, the Promise resolves. If authentication fails, the Promise is rejected with an instance of [`BiometryError`](#biometryerror), which has two properties:

| Property | Type                                                                                                    | Description                                       |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
| message  | string                                                                                                  | A description of the error suitable for debugging |
| code     | [BiometryErrorType](https://github.com/aparajita/capacitor-biometric-auth/blob/main/src/definitions.ts) | What caused the error                             |

#### Example

```typescript
import {
  AndroidBiometryStrength,
  BiometryError,
  BiometryErrorType,
} from './definitions'

async function authenticate(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    await BiometricAuth.authenticate({
      reason: 'Please authenticate',
      cancelTitle: 'Cancel',
      allowDeviceCredential: true,
      iosFallbackTitle: 'Use passcode',
      androidTitle: 'Biometric login',
      androidSubtitle: 'Log in using biometric authentication',
      androidConfirmationRequired: false,
      androidBiometryStrength: AndroidBiometryStrength.weak,
    })
  } catch (error) {
    // error is always an instance of BiometryError.
    if (error instanceof BiometryError) {
      if (error.code !== BiometryErrorType.userCancel) {
        // Display the error.
        await showAlert(error.message)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Biometry support

### web

On the web, you can fake any of the supported biometry types by calling [`setBiometryType()`](#setbiometrytype).

### iOS

On iOS, Touch ID and Face ID are supported.

### Android

On Android, fingerprint, face, and iris authentication are supported. Note that if a device supports more than one type of biometry, the plugin will initially present the primary (most secure) available type, which is determined by the system and cannot be determined programmatically.

‚ùó As discussed above, Android may support multiple types of biometry, but not all of them may be available for use by apps. For example, a device may support both fingerprint and face authentication, but only fingerprint authentication may be available for use by apps. In such cases, if the user has enrolled in face authentication only, `checkBiometry()` will indicate that biometry is not available.
